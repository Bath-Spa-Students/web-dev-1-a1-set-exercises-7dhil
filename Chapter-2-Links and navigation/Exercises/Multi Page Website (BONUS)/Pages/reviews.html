Refreshingly Fun

Parenthetically I don't know anything about the source material in particular or anime in general.
The series is compulsively watchable for several reasons.
The first is the world-building. The setting is fantastical but the show makes it effortlessly understandable and relatable.
The second is the characters. The characters here are mostly tropes but they're so likeable and well-realized by the performers that you can't help getting invested in them.
The third is the sense of light-hearted positivity that pervades the series. It touches on some pretty dark issues but the show and its irrepressibly-optimistic protagonist always have a positive outlook. People's faith in one another is actually rewarded rather than being mocked or denigrated. Image that in 2023.</p3><br>

GREAT ADAPTATION! As an old-school fan (since 2006) I can say that this was made with love for old fans and new fans! Welcome to the grand line! Next stop! The new world! I want season 2, 3, 4, 5! Etc Make it happen Netflix! You should be working on Chopper, looking for Robin, Ace, and Vivi... The cast is great, and the locations and CGI are on point! The small changes are OK, and it does not feel like forced. The chemistry is natural, and the scripts are well made.... as Oda-san said "This is good and can be better", I will watch this several times and with the different dubs! ENJOY NAKAMAS!!
