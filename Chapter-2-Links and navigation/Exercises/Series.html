    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p1>In a seafaring world, a young pirate captain sets out with his crew to attain the title of Pirate King, and to discover the mythical treasure known as 'One Piece.'
        An alternate version of Earth, and one that is currently in the midst of the 'Golden Age of Pirates'. Ruthless cut-throat pirates rule the seas, and only the strongest have the chance to lay claim to the mythical treasure known as 'One Piece' that was left behind by the greatest pirate of them all Gold Roger. Years after the death of Gold Roger, a young boy by the name of Monkey D. Luffy has dreams of raising his own crew, finding One Piece, and declaring himself as Pirate King. After eating a devil fruit that grants Luffy the power to make his body like rubber, it gives him enormous strength and agility. When Luffy finally comes of age, he sets sail from Foosha Village in East Blue and sets upon his grand adventure to become the next Pirate King.

Refreshingly Fun

Parenthetically I don't know anything about the source material in particular or anime in general.
The series is compulsively watchable for several reasons.
The first is the world-building. The setting is fantastical but the show makes it effortlessly understandable and relatable.
The second is the characters. The characters here are mostly tropes but they're so likeable and well-realized by the performers that you can't help getting invested in them.
The third is the sense of light-hearted positivity that pervades the series. It touches on some pretty dark issues but the show and its irrepressibly-optimistic protagonist always have a positive outlook. People's faith in one another is actually rewarded rather than being mocked or denigrated. Image that in 2023.</p3><br>

GREAT ADAPTATION! As an old-school fan (since 2006) I can say that this was made with love for old fans and new fans! Welcome to the grand line! Next stop! The new world! I want season 2, 3, 4, 5! Etc Make it happen Netflix! You should be working on Chopper, looking for Robin, Ace, and Vivi... The cast is great, and the locations and CGI are on point! The small changes are OK, and it does not feel like forced. The chemistry is natural, and the scripts are well made.... as Oda-san said "This is good and can be better", I will watch this several times and with the different dubs! ENJOY NAKAMAS!!
